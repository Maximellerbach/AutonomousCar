# TODO: document

You will really need to write some documentation

For my project, I use a really simple and basic AI model
to build it, I chose to use Keras and Tensorflow

My model is a light CNN (convolutionnal neural network)
it has to be light because it has to run in real time on a raspberry pi,
it's 30 dollars mini computer that runs on linux (raspbian).
